# diamonds_model
A basic ML model to predict diamonds prices based on multiple factors

After using a local CSV file to load the data into a DataFrame, some columns that will be used in the prediction had categorical data, these were transformed into numerical values.

Then a linear model is used with the cleaned table to produce with the relevent prices.
After testing the model, it had above 85% accuracy, with some very few invalid predictions

To-Do: train another model and produce to produce 0 invalid output
